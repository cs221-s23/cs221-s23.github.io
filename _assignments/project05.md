# IMPORTANT DATES
1. Monday, May 8th: project due date.
1. Wednesday, May 10th: Last day you may submit `project05` using late days. 
1. Thursday, May 11th: peer-grading during the class time. Missing the peer-grading session without a prior arrangement with the instructor results in 0. 

## Requirements

1. In this project, you will evolve the TCP socket (lab07) and a basic HTTP server (lab08) into a more capable HTTP server. 
1. You will add support for [path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL#path_to_resource) and embedded compontents such as [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) files in HTML. Note that you do not need to write a client-side program that handles CSS or any other HTML formatting. Your web browser will take care of it. 

## Example output

1. You need to set up SSH port forwarding. If you were using port 9000 (use the same port number you used for lab07 and lab08) on `vlab31`, then run the following command so that your web browser's connection to `localhost` on port 9000 will be forwarded to `vlab31` on port 9000.

	``sh
	ssh -L 9000:vlab31:9000 stargate
	``

1. Go to localhost:9000 on your web browser. Your HTTP server should respond. For the content of your server, use the content of CS221 website ![as shown below]({{ img_base }}/project05_screenshot.png).

1. Click on the links - the contents must match what you would see on the official CS221 website. 

## Implementation notes

1. Download the content of cs221 course website to serve from your own web server. To scrape the site, run

	``sh
	wget --recursive --page-requisites --convert-links cs221.cs.usfca.edu
	``
1. If you wish to store the content in `www` directory, move the contents as follows.
``sh
mv cs221.cs.usfca.edu www
``
1. You may use `ftell()` function to get the size of the file for the `Content-Length: ` part. 

1. You may use `strsep()` function to get the directory and file names from the URL. 


## Grading process

1. Project05 will be interactively graded by peers on Thursday, May 11th, the last class day of the semester using the rubric below. 
	1. Everyone will submit a google form with the scores. TAs will review for an error in grading and enter the scores in Canvas.
	1. An absence during the peer-grading session will result in 0 for project05. If you have a documented excuse, please arrange a make-up grading session with the instructor by May 4th. (The make-up session doesn't have to happen by May 4th. You just need to schedule one by then.) Failure to schedule a make-up sesion by May 4th will result in 0.
	1. Note that there is no resubmission for Project05 style. The peer-grading session happens on the last class day, so there is no time for resubmission and regrading. 

## Rubric

1. We will use the following rubric during peer-grading session.
	1. `path` support (40 pts): 
		1. The contents served from the HTTP server match what are served from the official CS221 website. 
	1. using non-blocking IO and `poll` (40 pts): 
		1. check the source code for the correct use of `ioctl`
		1. check the source code for the correct use of `poll` 
	1. Defensive coding (10 pts):
		1. Checking for memory and I/O errors (3 pts)
		1. No unbounded memory copies (3 pts)
		1. No memory leaks (4 pts)
	1. Style (10 pts): 
		1. Consistent naming and indentation (2 pts)
		1. Well-designed functions	(2 pts) 
		1. Helpful comments (2 pts)	
		1. No dead (commented-out) code or unnecessarily complex code (2 pts)	
		1. No build products or output dictionary files in the repo (2 pts)
